        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Milkshakes are a classic American frosty treat. A creamy combination of ice cream and milk, they're served at diners and dairy shops, including fast-food favorites like Dairy Queen, Burger King, and Sonic. And while they're a delicious treat to order alongside your burger, you can easily make them at home and save a few dollars. All you need are a few simple ingredients and a blender.</p>
        <p>With a bit of cookie crunch, rich chocolate sauce, and creamy texture, it's no wonder that people are so fond of this flavorful Oreo milkshake. Serve with a colorful straw.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pint vanilla ice cream (whatever a pint means)</li>
            <li>1 cup milk (whole milk apparently)</li>
            <li>8 Oreo cookies (or other chocolate sandwich cookies <em>(why make an oreo milkshake with other cookies??)</em>)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chocolate sauce</li>
            <li>2 Oreo cookies, garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients (<strong><em>duh!</em></strong>)</li>
            <li>Place the vanilla ice cream, milk, 8 Oreo cookies, and the chocolate sauce in a blender and puree until smooth.</li>
            <li>Crush the remaining 2 Oreo cookies for the garnish by placing them in a zip-close plastic bag and pounding on them a few times with a rolling pin until they crumble.</li>
            <li>Pour the milkshakes into 2 tall glasses and top each with the crushed Oreo cookie crumbs. Garnish with a straw.</li>
        </ol>
